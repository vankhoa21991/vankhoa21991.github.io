    <p>As an experienced Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer,
        I applied Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms to solve Computer Vision tasks in different industrial sectors
        from Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Fashion, Fishing industry to Neuromorphic Engineer, and most recently fighting 
        cancer with histological images and radiological images.

## My journey
<div class="right align">
    <p>Grew up in a standard family in Vietnam, sometimes when I look back I can not imagine how far I have gone from home in the last 10 years. My original background was Automation (Electric-Electrical) Engineer in Hochiminh University of Technology. Along side with my engineering program, I also joined AUF program, that teach French and other subjects in University.
    Being in the AUF program was a great honor for me, and opened up a opportunity to continue my study in France, with the Exellence scholarship from France Ambassador in Vietnam.

    It as a whole new life when I started my study in Troyes, first time I live far away from my family, an independent life in a strange place that I barely speak the language. I spent 4 years in this beautiful city for my student extended life. It was not always easy but I had a great time with my friends.

    <p>
    Now, after my PhD, I live and work in Coted'Azur, a wonderful place that I wouldn't imagine even in my dream that I will have a chance to live and work here. A place where I don't need to go on vacations anymore, and I decided to settle down here with my partner and start a new life together.
